# Module 10 Challenge

## Description
When the user is given a command-line application that accepts user input, then the user is prompted for text. Then, the user can enter up to three characters for their logo. When the user is prompted for the text color, then the user can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number). When the user is prompted for a shape, then the user is presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square. When the user is prompted for the shape's color, then the user can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number). When the user has entered input for all the prompts, then an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` and the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line. When the user opens the `logo.svg` file in a browser,
then they are shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria  they entered.
